If so, then would a lack of initial comparative analysis, and proper cost-benefit analysis not have been the root cause rather than the symptoms in these 4 steps?   I.e. Had you chosen a system that was more in line with your expertise, and that had some baked in security automation, would the project have failed if it was not hacked?
